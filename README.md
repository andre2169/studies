# Python Backend Studies 🐍

This repository was created for **practical studies in Python**, focusing on backend fundamentals.

The goal of this project is to practice concepts such as:
- Python syntax
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Functions and code reuse
- Basic backend logic
- Reading and understanding code step by step

This is **not a production project**.  
It is a learning repository where I test ideas, write exercises, and reinforce core programming concepts.

## 📚 What you will find here

- Small Python scripts
- Practical exercises
- Examples using:
  - Lists and dictionaries
